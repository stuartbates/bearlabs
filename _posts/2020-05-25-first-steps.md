## **Last Sprint**: New product, quickly invalidated

The Quick Flip Rob mentioned in our first post came from a tool I built in 2016 called GitHawk. This allowed companies to find developers based on the code they've actually written on GitHub.

It was intended as a tool for finding candidates but the costs associated with downloading and storing all that data were prohibitive!

More recently, it occurred to me we might be able to re-purpose the same codebase as a screening tool to help recruiters who, in the main, are not technical.

Now this might not sound like the new and improved process we were talking about. It sounds a lot like we're going solution first!

Fear not, our first step on this was to articulate the problem GitHawk was intending to solve. The assumption that:

> Recruiters are not technical and therefore struggle to assess the quality of a potential candidate.

We reached out on LinkedIn to set up problem interviews with recruiters both internal and external to start talking and learning.

We wrote up a set of problem interview questions (using the Mom Test as a guide) to start getting an unbiased and truthful look at their problems.

After writing up the first 5 interviews we started work on a Value Prop Canvas - pulling out the jobs, pains and gains that our customers had described in our first conversations.

It quickly became apparent we had too many pains and gains to solve and not enough data on which ones are the most severe.

## **Next Sprint**: Further discovery

Right now, we think the most important thing to do is to simply speak to more users.

We're aiming to get a pipeline of interviews set up so we can keep momentum over the next few sprints.

We've refined the interview questions to focus on the most common areas that came up previously and also added a card sorting exercise where we force people to pick a limited number of pains and gains that matter to them most.

Hopefully, this will provide us with some confidence to zoom in a little and let us focus on solving the right problems when we move onto generating our first Value Props for testing.

Running in parallel we're also starting to flesh out the business environment map with competitors, industry trends and market forces that should help us shape the value propositions in the next phase.

Hopefully, the next one of these updates will be Rob talking about how we came up with and started to test our first handful of value propositions!
