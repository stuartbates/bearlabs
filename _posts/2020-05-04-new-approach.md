This post is the first in a series, where we'll post ever two weeks to chart our progress.

Why? We did a full retrospective on our process, and decided it needed a lot of improving.

Long story short, we spent the past 8 months on an idea we quickly wanted to test in 6 weeks. When we took a step back, we realised it was far too small a market to spent that much time on.

Learned two things:
- It's very easy to get sucked in. We had some nice signals and early paying customers, but remotely enough for the amount of time we spent
- It's very difficult to practice what you preach

So, we've begun to overhaul our process, and we've decided that:
- We're going to spend more time picking a problem to solve. Building any product is difficult. We need to make sure we’re doing the right one (i.e. one with enough payoff, and that we care about)
- We're going to put in more guardrails, and this is one of them. If we’re not proud of what we’re writing on this blog, that’s a bad sign

What next? We're looking at three things:
- A ‘Quick flip’ idea in the recruitment space
- Pivoting Inquisitive to focus on sales outcome
- An idea in the Talent Mapping space with a contact/good friend of ours
